### Abstract
Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women. It occurs when a few breast cells begin to grow abnormally. The Wisconsin Kaggle dataset is used for this experiment. This study is aimed to predict breast cancer using hybrid machine learning approaches, applying ML models like Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). In our project, we are implementing Hybrid algorithms using PCA and SVM and optimizing SVM with k-fold cross-validation for predicting Breast cancer at early stages with high accuracy. The goal is to increase the proportion of breast cancer detection at early stages and to reduce error rate with maximum accuracy. The Hybrid model, a combination of PCA with SVM got an accuracy of 96% and its performance is better when compared with traditional SVM.
### ML Models Proposed in this work
- **Support Vector Machine(SVM)** :Malignant or benign tumors are classified using the SVM algorithm. SVM produces results that are accurate and precise.
- **Principal Component Analysis** :To reduce the dimensionality of the dataset.
- **K-Fold Cross-Validation** :The model's accuracy is examined using 10-fold cross-validation.

### Other possible Approaches
- The Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset is the only dataset where the recommended approaches produce reliable results.The lack of validation on multiple datasets raises concerns about the robustness and applicability of the approach across different populations.
